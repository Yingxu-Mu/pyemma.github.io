This is the key part I read from the book *<<How To Read A Book>>*, how to do analytical reading.

> Figure out what a book is about

1. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter. (Is it a theory book or a practical book?)
2. State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity.
3. Enumerate its major part in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole. (The structure of the book.)
4. Define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve.

>  Finding what a book says

5. Come to terms with the author by interpreting his key words. (Those words that you are not comfortable with are usually keywords.)
6. Grasp the author's leading proposition by dealing with his most important sentences. (Interpreting the key sentences in your own words or use your own examples to illustrate the meaning of those sentences.)
7. Know the author's arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences.
8. Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; and as to the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve.

> Criticizing a book as a communication of knowledge

9. Do not begin criticism until you have completed your outline and your interpretation of the book. (Do not say you agree, disagree, or suspend judgment, until you can say "I understand.")
10. Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously.
11. Demonstrate that you recognize the difference between knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting good reasons for any critical judgment you make.
12. Show wherein the author is uninformed/misinformed/illogical/incomplete.
